When you pull a molecule or complex (like a protofibril) along a particular direction:
Avoid interactions with periodic images
PBC “wraps” the system, so atoms on one edge can interact with atoms on the opposite edge.
To avoid this, your box length along the pulling direction must be at least twice the pulling distance.
Pull distance < 1/2 box length
If the pull distance exceeds half the box length, the minimum image convention causes GROMACS to calculate the distance incorrectly (it will “wrap around” the box).
So if you want to pull 5 nm, your box along that axis should be at least 10 nm.
Place your molecule off-center
This ensures that there is enough space in the pulling direction for the molecule to move without hitting the box edge.

How to calculate box size
Let’s define variables:
d_pull = total pulling distance (nm)
L_box = box length along pulling direction (nm)

minimum requirement: L_box >= 2 x d_pull


Example:
Pull distance = 5.0 nm
Box length = 12.0 nm  (greater than 2 × 5 = 10 nm)
This extra space (12 − 5 = 7 nm) allows the protofibril to sit away from the edge, so you can place its center of mass somewhere in the box (not at 0 or at the maximum coordinate) to allow a full pull.
